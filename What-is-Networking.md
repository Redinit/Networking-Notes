# 🌐 What is Networking?

Networking is simply about connecting devices together so they can communicate and share resources.

A network can be as small as two devices connected with a cable, or as large as the entire Internet, which connects millions of devices worldwide.

## 👉 In simple words:
A network is a collection of devices connected to each other for the purpose of sharing resources, information, and communication.

### These devices can include:

* 💻 Computers & Laptops

* 📱 Smartphones & Tablets

* 📡 Routers & Switches

* 🖨 Printers, Servers, Smart TVs, and more

## Why do we use Networking?

### Networking allows us to:

* 📂 Share data and files (documents, videos, photos)

* 📞 Make voice calls and video calls (Zoom, WhatsApp, Teams)

* 🌍 Access the Internet (browsing, gaming, streaming)

* 🖨 Use shared resources (like printers or cloud storage)

## Example

When you connect your phone, laptop, and TV to your home Wi-Fi, they are all part of a LAN (Local Area Network).

*Now imagine:*

Your LAN connects to your neighbor’s LAN,

Many LANs connect together into bigger networks (like offices, schools, ISPs),

Multiple LANs and WANs (Wide Area Networks) across the world connect together…
