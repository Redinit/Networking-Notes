Welcome to my **Networking Notes** repository! 🚀  
I’ve just started my journey into the world of **computer networking**, and this repo is where I’ll be writing down what I learn step by step.  

## 📌 About  
This repo is a **beginner-friendly collection of notes** as I explore networking from scratch.  
It’s not perfect or complete yet — it’s a work in progress that grows as I learn more.  

## 📖 What I’ll Cover (so far)  
- 🔹 What is Networking?
- 🔹 Working of Switch
- 🔹 Working of Router
- 🔹 OSI & TCP/IP models (basics) 
- 🔹 IP Addressing & Subnetting (starting soon)

## 🎯 Purpose  
- To track my own progress 📈  
- To build a personal reference for networking concepts  
- To share simple notes with others starting their journey  

## 🛠️ Status  
👉 Currently at the **starting point** of networking.  
More topics will be added as I keep learning.
