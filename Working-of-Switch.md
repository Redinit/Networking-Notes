# Switching in Networking

## üìå What is Switching?
A **switch** operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model.  
It forwards **frames** between devices based on **MAC addresses**.


---
üìå **Reminder:**  
At the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**, the data unit is called a **frame**.  
A frame contains:  
- Source MAC address  
- Destination MAC address  
- Data (payload)  

üëâ Frames are what switches use to forward traffic.  
(See [OSI Model](../OSI_Model.md) for a full breakdown of layers and data units.)

## ‚ö° How Switching Works
1. **Frame Creation**  
   - A device (e.g., PC1) sends data to PC2.  
   - The frame contains:  
     - **Source MAC** (PC1)  
     - **Destination MAC** (PC2)
       
       ![frame](./Images/PC1-to-PC2-Frame.png)
       
2. **Switch Checks MAC Table (CAM Table)**  
   - If the **destination MAC is known**, the frame is sent **only to that port**.  
   - If the **MAC is unknown**, the switch **floods** the frame to all ports except the incoming one.

3. **Learning Process**  
   - The switch learns MAC addresses by recording the **source MAC** of each frame in its **Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table** along with the port.  

4. **ARP in Action**  
   - If PC1 knows PC2‚Äôs **IP address** but not its MAC, it sends an **ARP Request**.  
   - ARP Request is a **broadcast frame** with destination `FFF.FFF.FFF.FFF`(Broadcast MAC Address).

   - PC2 responds with its MAC, and the switch learns both MACs during this exchange.

## üîë Key Features of Switching
- **Flooding** ‚Üí Sends frames to all ports when destination MAC is unknown.  
- **Learning** ‚Üí Builds CAM table using source MACs.  
- **Forwarding** ‚Üí Sends frames directly to the correct port (unicast).  
- **Broadcasting** ‚Üí Used for ARP, DHCP requests, etc.

## üñºÔ∏è Example Flow
- PC1 wants to ping PC2.  
- PC1 sends ARP Request (`FFF.FFF.FFF.FFF`) ‚Üí Switch floods it.
- PC2 replies with its MAC ‚Üí Switch learns PC2‚Äôs MAC in CAM table.  
- Now PC1 ‚Üî PC2 communication goes directly via their ports (no flooding needed).

‚úÖ **Summary:**  
Switching = **Flood ‚Üí Learn ‚Üí Forward**
