# TCP/IP Model

| TCP/IP Model |
|--------------|
|4. Application  |
|3. Transport    |
|2. Internet     |
|1. Link         |

The TCP/IP model is the real-world networking model with 4 layers. It performs the same functions as the OSI model, but some layers are combined.

## OSI vs TCP/IP Comparison

| OSI Model | TCP/IP Model | Examples |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Application | Application | HTTP, FTP, DNS |
| Presentation | Application | SSL/TLS, JPEG |
| Session | Application | RPC, NetBIOS |
| Transport | Transport | TCP, UDP |
| Network | Internet | IP, ICMP |
| Data Link | Link | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |
| Physical | Link | Cables, NICs |

## Key Notes
- OSI = theoretical, 7 layers, detailed.
- TCP/IP = practical, 4 layers, used in real networking.
- Functions are the same, just grouped differently.
